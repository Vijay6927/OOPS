Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice 
for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information 
as instance.
Data Members ‐
• partNumber (type String)
• partDescription (type String)
• quantity of the item being purchased (type int)
• price_per_item (type double)
Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. 
Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. In addition, provide a 
method named getInvoiceAmount() that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., 
multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double 
value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not 
positive,it should be set to0.0. Write a test application named invoiceTest that 
demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.

        }
