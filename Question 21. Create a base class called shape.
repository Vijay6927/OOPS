Question 21. Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to compute the area of figures. Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from base shape. Add to the base class, a member function get_data() to initialize base class data members and another member function display_area() to compute and display the area of figures. Make display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Using these three classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle interactively and display the area. Remember the two values given as input will be treated as lengths of two sides in the case of rectangles and as base and height in the case of triangle and used as follows: Area of rectangle = x * y Area of triangle = Â½ *x*y.
#include <iostream>

// Base class
class Shape {
protected:
    double side1;
    double side2;

public:
    // Member function to initialize base class data members
    void get_data() {
        std::cout << "Enter the dimensions of the shape:" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Side 1: ";
        std::cin >> side1;
        std::cout << "Side 2: ";
        std::cin >> side2;
    }

    // Virtual function to compute and display the area of the shape
    virtual void display_area() const {
        std::cout << "Area of the shape: ";
    }
};

// Derived class for Triangle
class Triangle : public Shape {
public:
    // Redefine the display_area() function for Triangle
    void display_area() const override {
        Shape::display_area();
        double area = 0.5 * side1 * side2;
        std::cout << area << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class for Rectangle
class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    // Redefine the display_area() function for Rectangle
    void display_area() const override {
        Shape::display_area();
        double area = side1 * side2;
        std::cout << area << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shapePtr; // Pointer to the base class

    int choice;
    std::cout << "Enter the shape (1 for Triangle, 2 for Rectangle): ";
    std::cin >> choice;

    if (choice == 1) {
        Triangle triangle;
        shapePtr = &triangle;
    } else if (choice == 2) {
        Rectangle rectangle;
        shapePtr = &rectangle;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Invalid choice!" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Get data and display area
    shapePtr->get_data();
    shapePtr->display_area();

    return 0;
