1. An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users to discourage large consumption of energy.
For the first 100 units:-  60 P per unit 
For the next 200 units:- 80 P per unit
Beyond 300 units:- 90 P per unit
All users are charged a minimum of Rs 50 if the total amount is more than Rs 300, then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.
Implement a C++ program to read the names of users and number of units consumed 
and display the charges with names.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    float charge,scharge;
    string name;
    cout<<"\nEnter name and number of units consumed:\t";
    cin>>name;
    cin>>n;
    if(n<=100)
        charge=(0.60*n);
    if(n>100 && n<=300)
    {

        charge=  100*.6 +(n-100)*0.80;
    }
    if(n>=300)
    {

        charge= 100*.6 + 200*.8 +(n-300)*0.90;
    }
    if(charge<50)
        charge=50;
    if(charge>300)
    {
        scharge=(0.15*charge);
        charge= charge + .15*charge;
    }

    cout<<"electricity bill \n";
    cout<<name<<" : : Rs. "<<charge;


}
